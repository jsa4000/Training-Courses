Learning Types

- Unsupervised Learning. This is a learning based on clustering the data into a sets or groups. The labels are not given so the algorithm need to search for patterns and correlations between the features in the data.
- supervised Learning. This is a learning based in inputs and labeles. The algorithm learn the features in order to make prediciton based in the inputs and it's labels. P(Y|X)
- Reinforcement learning. Learning based in rewards and states in which the agent need to go through by in order to get the best solution or goal at the end.
