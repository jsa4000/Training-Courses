#Artificial Intelligence

In this course, you will learn the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and apply them to the design and implementation of intelligent agents that solve real-world AI problems, including problems in search, games, machine learning, logic, and constraint satisfaction.

We will provide a broad understanding of the basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems.  Topics include the history of AI, intelligent agents, state-space problem representations, uninformed and heuristic search, game playing and adversarial search, logical agents, constraint satisfaction problems, along with techniques in machine learning and other applications of AI, such as natural language processing (NLP).

##Course Level

Please note this is a Master’s/graduate level course. Expect to spend at least several hours to complete the programming assignments, although the exact amount of time will depend on your background and proficiency with coding. If you are taking this course for fun, and are not working towards a passing grade for credit, you can of course watch the lectures and answer the quizzes.

##Prerequisites

You are required to have some knowledge of programming and an understanding of probability. Python is the programming language in this course.
